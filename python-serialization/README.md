# Python - Serialization

This project introduces the concept of serialization in Python.

It focuses on converting Python data structures into JSON format
and saving them to files, then loading and deserializing the JSON
data back into Python objects.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what serialization and deserialization are
- Convert Python dictionaries to JSON files
- Load JSON files and recreate Python dictionaries
- Use the `json` module for data handling

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files must be executable
- Code should follow Python best practices
