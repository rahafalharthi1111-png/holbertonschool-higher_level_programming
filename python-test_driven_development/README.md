# Python - Test Driven Development

This project introduces the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD) in Python.

### Task 0: Integers addition
You must write a function that adds two integers, following these rules:

- The function must be named `add_integer`.
- The function must accept two arguments: `a` and `b`.
- `a` and `b` must be integers or floats.
- If they are floats, they must be cast to integers.
- If `a` or `b` is not an integer or float, raise a `TypeError`.
- Return the addition of the two numbers.
- No external modules are allowed.
- Test cases must be written using doctest.
